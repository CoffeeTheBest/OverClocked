## üõ†Ô∏è Log Management

### Using npm scripts:
```bash
# List all log files and their sizes
npm run logs:list

# Clean logs older than 30 days
npm run logs:clean

# Show log statistics
npm run logs:stats

# View recent logs (default: general, 50 lines)
npm run logs:view

# View specific log type
npm run logs:view payments

# View specific log type with custom line count
npm run logs:view orders 100

# Search logs for specific terms
npm run logs:search auth "login failed"
```

### Using the script directly:
```bash
# List logs
node scripts/logManager.js list

# Clean old logs (keep last 7 days)
node scripts/logManager.js clean 7

# View payment logs (last 20 lines)
node scripts/logManager.js view payments 20

# Search auth logs for failed logins
node scripts/logManager.js search auth "login failed"

# View error logs
node scripts/logManager.js view errors
```

## üìä Log Format

### Payment Logs Example:
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-07-31T05:25:35.749Z",
  "level": "info",
  "service": "overclocked-api",
  "logType": "payments",
  "message": "Payment intent created for user Huzaifa",
  "paymentIntentId": "pi_3Rqozj...",
  "userId": "507f1f77bcf86cd799439011",
  "amount": 99.99,
  "currency": "usd"
}
```

### Authentication Logs Example:
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-07-31T05:26:10.236Z",
  "level": "info",
  "service": "overclocked-api",
  "logType": "auth",
  "message": "User login successful",
  "userId": "507f1f77bcf86cd799439011",
  "username": "Huzaifa",
  "email": "huzaifa@example.com",
  "role": "user",
  "action": "login_success"
}
```

### Order Logs Example:
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-07-31T05:26:10.236Z",
  "level": "info",
  "service": "overclocked-api",
  "logType": "orders",
  "message": "Order created successfully",
  "orderId": "688afe72f70d9a9474773312",
  "userId": "507f1f77bcf86cd799439011",
  "username": "Huzaifa",
  "total": 99.99,
  "itemCount": 2,
  "paymentIntentId": "pi_3Rqozj..."
}
```

## üö´ GitHub Protection

### .gitignore Configuration
The following patterns are ignored by Git:
```
# logs
*.log
logs/
build.log
**/logs/
**/*.log
```

This ensures that:
- ‚úÖ No log files are ever committed to Git
- ‚úÖ No sensitive payment data is exposed
- ‚úÖ Log directories are completely ignored
- ‚úÖ All log file extensions are protected

## üîç Monitoring Logs

### Development
- Logs are displayed in console during development
- Real-time payment tracking
- Immediate error visibility

### Production
- Logs are written to files only
- No console output for security
- Automatic log rotation
- Structured JSON format for easy parsing

## üìà Best Practices

1. **Regular Monitoring**: Check logs daily for errors
2. **Log Rotation**: Clean old logs monthly
3. **Security**: Never commit logs to Git
4. **Backup**: Consider backing up important logs
5. **Analysis**: Use log data for business insights
6. **Search**: Use the search functionality to find specific events
7. **Organization**: Use separate log files for different concerns

## üö® Important Notes

- **Sensitive Data**: All payment information is automatically sanitized
- **Performance**: Logs are written asynchronously to avoid blocking
- **Storage**: Monitor log directory size regularly
- **Compliance**: Logs help with PCI DSS compliance for payments
- **Organization**: Each log type has its own file for easier management
- **Search**: Use the search functionality to quickly find specific events
